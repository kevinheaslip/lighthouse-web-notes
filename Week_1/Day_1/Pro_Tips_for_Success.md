## Pro Tips for Success

Here are some tips that previous students have found useful:
1. Before you start your day, scan the schedule for the section you're on.
2. Do this for specific assignments too. It can be incredibly useful to know what the end result should look like.
3. If you are ahead: Before jumping onto the next section assignments, seek out a mentor to review and give you feedback on one of your solutions, challenge you on your work, or even just advise you on what to pursue next.
4. If you're behind and you can't finish everything, take a deep breath. You can work to catch up. In these cases, prioritization is your best friend. Seek out guidance from your delivery team. And as a general rule, abide by the 80/20 ratio: Spend 80% of your day on the current section's material and only 20% of your day on catchup. This will help you avoid the trap of falling further and further behind.
5. Remember: You are here to learn so throw your ego out the door. Take chances, make mistakes, and get messy.
