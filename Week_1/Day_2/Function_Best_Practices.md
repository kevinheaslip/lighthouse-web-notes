## Best Pracitices for Functions

1. Give your functions precise verb/action based names
2. Use camelCasedNames (like this one)
3. Properly indent the function code
4. Functions should focus on a single task: returning a value or causing a side effect. Break your function into additional smaller functions if you find it doing two or more things
    * One single task could be to compute and return a value (eg: zeroPad)
    * Another single task could be to perform a side effect such as logging a message to the screen (eg: printFarmInventory)
5. It is ideal if functions try to avoid reading outer scope variables. If a function needs some information / data, then that data should instead be passed in as a parameter, making it available within the function's inner scope
