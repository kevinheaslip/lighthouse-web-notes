## Falsey Values in JavaScript

All of the following are inherently falsey:

```Javascript 
False
```
* False is False. Makes sense, right?

```Javascript 
0
```
* 0 is the only falsey Number

```Javascript 
""
```
* an empty string is falsey

```Javascript 
null
```
* a null, or empty value, is falsey.

```Javascript 
undefined
```
* an object that has not been defined is considered falsey.

```Javascript 
NaN
```
* Not a Number. You'll learn more about NaN as we go on.
